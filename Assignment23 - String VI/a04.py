Cloud Storage Duplicate File Name Resolver

A cloud storage company stores uploaded filenames from users.

Sometimes multiple duplicate filenames are uploaded.

The system should:

• Keep the first occurrence unchanged.
• Add (1), (2), (3)... for duplicate filenames.

Write a Python program to rename duplicate filenames.

Input:
file file image file image data

Output:
file file(1) image file(2) image(1) data
