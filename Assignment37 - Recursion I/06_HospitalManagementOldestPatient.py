Question 6: Hospital Management System – Oldest Patient

A hospital wants to give priority to the oldest patient during a free health check-up camp. The patient details are stored as tuples containing the patient's name and age.

As a Python developer, write a program to identify the oldest patient using the reduce() function with a lambda expression.

Input:
patients = [
    ("Rahul", 45),
    ("Sneha", 62),
    ("Amit", 38),
    ("Kiran", 71),
    ("Pooja", 55)
]

Expected Output:
Oldest Patient: Kiran

from functools  import reduce

def old(x,y):
    
    if x[1]<y[1]:
        return y
    return x


patients = [
    ("Rahul", 45),
    ("Sneha", 62),
    ("Amit", 38),
    ("Kiran", 71),
    ("Pooja", 55)
]


ans=reduce(old,patients)
