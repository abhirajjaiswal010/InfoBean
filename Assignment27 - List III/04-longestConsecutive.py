# 4. Longest Consecutive Sequence
# ============================================================
#
# Scenario:
# Find the longest sequence of consecutive numbers present
# in the list.
#
# Requirements:
# - Read N and list elements from the user.
# - Find the length of the longest consecutive sequence.
# - Display the sequence length.
#
# Note:
# The numbers do not need to be adjacent in the original list.
#
# Test Case 1:
# Input:
# [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
#
# Output:
# Longest Consecutive Length = 4
#
# Explanation:
# The longest consecutive sequence is:
# 1, 2, 3, 4
#
# Test Case 2:
# Input:
# [10, 11, 12, 20]
#
# Output:
# Longest Consecutive Length = 3
#
# Explanation:
# The longest consecutive sequence is:
# 10, 11, 12
#
# Test Case 3:
# Input:
# [5, 2, 99, 3, 4, 1, 100]
#
# Output:
# Longest Consecutive Length = 4
#
# Explanation:
# The longest consecutive sequence is:
# 1, 2, 3, 4
